# bun.lock in the repo - even though mise.toml, the Dockerfile and CI all pin
# yarn 1. Unpin once the toolchain is deliberately moved to bun.

# Held at 5.x on purpose. Action Cable's Redis subscription adapter - the
# production `adapter: redis` in config/cable.yml, which every live scoreboard
# and scoring broadcast goes through - does `gem "redis", ">= 4", "< 6"` at
# require time (actioncable/lib/action_cable/subscription_adapter/redis.rb).
# redis 6 therefore raises Gem::LoadError the moment that adapter loads, and
# nothing in the test suite catches it because config/cable.yml uses the test
# adapter in test. Revisit when Rails relaxes the bound.
