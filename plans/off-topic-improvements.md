## Found while wiring up the dev-env standard (mise / hk / CI), 2026-08-07

Every item below is a **pre-existing** issue: each was verified to predate that work. Together
they are why six of the sixteen hk gates are currently red.

### App bugs

- **`app/views/layouts/_navbar.html.erb:1` — stray comma between HTML attributes.**
  `<nav class="navbar bg-dark navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary", data-bs-theme="dark">`.
  Invalid markup: browsers recover, but it is the *only* thing failing both
  `bundle exec herb analyze app/` and `bundle exec herb lint app/`. Deleting the comma makes
  `herb analyze` report 43/43 files clean (verified).

- **`app/services/statistics_service.rb:36` — `NoMethodError: undefined method 'min' for nil`.**
  `generate_time_intervals` assumes a non-nil `start_time`; it is nil when the `chart_start_time`
  setting is absent. Causes 3 of the 4 errors in `bin/rails test`
  (`test/services/statistics_service_test.rb`).

- **`test/channels/application_cable/connection_test.rb` — 1 error.** The fourth of the four
  pre-existing test errors.

### Security findings

- **`app/controllers/users_controller.rb:56` — Mass Assignment (brakeman `PermitAttributes`).**
  `params.require(:user).permit(:email, :name, :role, ...)` lets a user set their own `:role`
  if the action is reachable without an authorisation check. Worth confirming CanCanCan blocks
  it, and dropping `:role` from the permit list for non-admins either way.

- **`app/services/statistics_service.rb:22` — possible SQL injection (brakeman).**
  `team.results.where("#{time_column} <= ?", interval)` interpolates a column name. Low risk if
  `time_column` is derived internally, but it should be validated against an allowlist of
  column names rather than interpolated.

- **`bundle exec bundle-audit check` — CVEs across ~21 gems**, including rails/actionpack/
  activerecord/activesupport, rack, nokogiri, puma, devise, loofah, rexml and websocket-driver.
  The tree is well behind (Rails 7.2.1). Owned by a dedicated dependency-upgrade pass; do not
  chip at it piecemeal.

### Code quality

- **`bin/rubocop` — 201 offences (198 autocorrectable)** in four files:
  `config/initializers/devise.rb`, `config/initializers/simple_form.rb`,
  `config/initializers/simple_form_bootstrap.rb` and
  `db/migrate/20240828214914_update_users_to_challenges.rb`. Almost all `Style/StringLiterals`
  (single vs. double quotes) in generator-produced files. `bin/rubocop -A` fixes them; the hk
  pre-commit hook will do it automatically on the next commit that stages those files.

- **`.herb.yml` holds an adoption baseline of 11 parked rules.** Written by
  `herb lint app/ --disable-failing` so herb could be adopted without blocking every commit.
  It is a to-do list, not a policy. 48 of the 64 original offences are
  `herb lint app/ --fix`-able. Highest-value ones to re-enable first:
  `erb-no-instance-variables-in-partials` (7 offences — partials reaching for `@ivars` instead
  of locals) and `html-input-require-autocomplete` (3 — an a11y/UX win on the login form).

- **`.jscpd.json` sets `threshold: 1.1` instead of the standard's `0`.** Two pre-existing
  clones: `app/assets/stylesheets/login.css:1-7` ~ `scoreboard.css:3-9`, and
  `test/system/home_test.rb:40-60` ~ `80-100` (the guest and team-user table assertions, which
  differ only in an extra navbar check). De-duplicate both, then put the threshold back
  to `0` so any new duplication fails the gate.

- **`config/initializers/simple_form_bootstrap.rb` is excluded from jscpd** — it is
  simple_form generator boilerplate with three internal clones. Excluded rather than
  refactored, in the same spirit as `db/schema.rb`.

- **`bundle exec debride` — ~140 suspect LOC.** Notably
  `Result#ensure_zero_points`, `User#clear_scoreboard_cache`, and the `new`/`edit`/`show`
  actions on `UsersController`. Advisory — debride cannot see calls from views, ActionCable or
  routes, so verify before deleting anything.

- **`bundle exec flay` — total score 375.** Largest: the near-identical
  `app/views/devise/passwords/new.html.erb` and `devise/unlocks/new.html.erb` (mass 118, a
  shared partial waiting to happen), a 3-way repeat in `challenges/index.html.erb:56-64`, and
  duplicated blocks in `challenges_controller.rb:40/55` and `:43/58`.

- **`bundle exec database_consistency` — 21 model/schema mismatches** (run it with a DB up).
  The substantive ones: `Setting#value`, `Challenge#number`, `#description`, `#points` and
  `#group_id` should be `NOT NULL`; `Result` and `GroupPermission` lack `dependent:` /
  `on_delete` on their `user` association, so deleting a user orphans rows; and
  `index_results_on_user_id` / `index_group_permissions_on_user_id` are redundant, each fully
  covered by a composite index.

### Tooling / environment

- **The `bin/brakeman` binstub injects `--ensure-latest`.** Combined with `./bin` on `$PATH`
  (as on the author's machine) it shadows the gem for `bundle exec brakeman`, so the step fails
  on "not the latest version" instead of on the scan — and CI, which has no `./bin` on `$PATH`,
  would not reproduce it. Worked around in `hk.pkl` and `ci.yml` by loading the executable via
  `Gem.bin_path`. The tidier fix is to drop the `--ensure-latest` line from `bin/brakeman` and
  let bundler-audit/Dependabot handle staying current.

- **Upstream, in the `dev-hooks:dev-env-setup` skill:** the Ruby template's
  `database_consistency` step probes with `bin/rails runner "ActiveRecord::Base.connection"`,
  which is **lazy on Rails 7.2** — it returns a connection object without contacting the
  server, so the probe exits 0 with no database running and database_consistency then dies on
  its first checker. It needs `.execute('SELECT 1')` to force the connection. Fixed locally in
  `hk.pkl`; worth pushing back to the template.

- **Upstream, in `writing:github-readme`'s `github_readme_audit.py`:** its "exactly one H1"
  check counts `#`-prefixed lines inside fenced code blocks. The nginx sample in `README.md`
  legitimately contains `# New server block ...`, which the audit reports as a second H1. The
  check should skip fenced blocks.

## Found while moving the app onto Turbo, 2026-08-07

### App bugs

- **`app/javascript/controllers/statistics_controller.js` logs the whole dataset to the
  console** on every render (`console.log("StatisticsController:", title, data)`). It is the
  last `console.log` left in the app now that the channel plumbing is gone; the two charts on
  `/statistics` dump their full point series into the browser console in production.

  `ScoringController#update` (server side) has the matching gap: it takes both columns from
  the request and overwrites unconditionally, so it cannot detect a stale write either.
  Fixes worth considering: send only the changed field, serialise per (challenge, user) on
  the client, or add optimistic locking (`lock_version` / `updated_at` precondition) so a
  stale update is rejected rather than applied. The system test now works around it by
  committing one field at a time and waiting for each save to land.
## Found during the dependency-upgrade pass, 2026-08-07

- **The Node pin (22.4.1) is now holding dependencies back.** `sass` 1.100.0+ requires
  `chokidar` 5, which is ESM-only, so `yarn build:css` dies with `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` — `require(esm)`
  only landed in Node 22.12. `package.json` therefore caps sass at `<1.100.0`. Bumping the Node
  pin (mise.toml + `.node-version` + `Dockerfile` `ARG NODE_VERSION`, all in lockstep) to a
  current 22.x LTS would let that cap go. The same pin also blocks `esbuild` 0.25+, which
  requires Node >= 18 but ships transitive tooling assuming newer.

- **CI never installs Node or Yarn for the `test` job.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` sets up Ruby
  via `ruby/setup-ruby` and then runs `bin/rails db:test:prepare test test:system`, which invokes
  `yarn install` through jsbundling/cssbundling — on whatever Node the runner image happens to
  ship, not the 22.4.1 that `mise.toml`, `.node-version` and the `Dockerfile` all pin. After this
  upgrade the lockfile contains `brace-expansion@5`, whose `engines` field requires
  `20 || >=22`, so a runner image that regressed to Node 18 would break the build. The `lint`
  and `actions-lint` jobs already use `jdx/mise-action`; the `test` job should too (or add
  `actions/setup-node` with `node-version-file: .node-version`).

- **`mise exec -- <cmd>` does not put mise's Node on `PATH` for grandchildren.**
  `mise exec -- node --version` reports 22.4.1 but `mise exec -- which node` reports
  `/usr/bin/node` (18.19.1), so `mise exec -- bin/rails test` runs the yarn asset build on the
  *system* Node. It happens to work today; it silently defeats the pin. Anyone driving this repo
  non-interactively should prepend the mise install dirs to `PATH` explicitly rather than rely on
  `mise exec`.

- **`Gemfile.lock` was resolved with Bundler 2.5.13, which predates the `cooldown:` feature.**
  The cooldown is nevertheless applied (it is set in `~/.bundle/config`), and it held Rails back
  from 7.2.3.2 to 7.2.3 even though 7.2.3.2 was nine days old at the time — well outside the
  4-day window. Worth re-checking once `BUNDLED WITH` moves to a Bundler that implements
  cooldown natively; until then, security floors need to be spelled out in the `Gemfile`.

- **`Dockerfile:49` still runs `bundle exec bootsnap precompile --gemfile`, but bootsnap is gone.**
  Commit 9ea25e5 ("Remove bootsnap because it doesn't play nice") dropped the gem —
  `rg bootsnap Gemfile Gemfile.lock` finds nothing, and `config/boot.rb` has
  `require "bootsnap/setup"` commented out — but the Dockerfile's precompile step was left
  behind. `bundle exec bootsnap` with the gem absent exits non-zero, which should fail the image
  build. Not verified with an actual `docker build` (too slow for this pass), but it looks like a
  real break on a branch named `fix-portainer-deployment`. Delete the line.

- **`rubocop-rails-omakase` is held at 1.0.0.** 1.1.0 registers rubocop-minitest via `plugins:`
  instead of `require:`, which enables several more Minitest cops. The only resulting offence is
  `Minitest/RefuteFalse` at `test/system/settings_test.rb:36` (`assert_equal false, ...` should be
  `refute ...`) — autocorrectable with `bin/rubocop -A`. Fix it and drop the hold.
- **`ChallengesController#index` assigns `@challenges` twice.** `load_and_authorize_resource`
  has already set it to `Challenge.accessible_by(current_ability)` by the time the action body
  overwrites it with `Challenge.visible_to(current_user).includes(:results)`, so the first
  relation is built and thrown away. Harmless (it is lazy) but confusing; `skip_load_resource
  only: :index` would say what is meant.

- **Completion stats on `/challenges` are still not live** (the FIXME at the top of the view).
  They are per-challenge rather than per-team, so they need a challenge-wide stream rather than
  the per-user one the scores use — `Result` would broadcast to `[challenge, :stats]` and the
  scorer view would subscribe. Small, and now that the scores go over Turbo it is a five-line
  addition rather than a fourth channel.

- **`Challenge#completion_stats` and `User#stats` are N+1s.** Both are called once per row while
  rendering (`challenges/_challenge_row`, `home/index`), and each runs two or three COUNT
  queries. Fine at scavenger-hunt scale, but they are the reason a broadcast re-render of the
  scorer's challenge list is the most expensive thing the app does.

- **CI never pins Node, so asset builds use whatever the runner ships.**
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` pins Ruby properly (`ruby-version: .ruby-version` on every job) but
  the `test` job runs `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` and `bin/rails test:system` with no
  `actions/setup-node` and no `jdx/mise-action` step, so esbuild/sass run on the runner's default
  Node rather than the 22.4.1 pinned in `mise.toml` / `.node-version`. That contradicts
  CLAUDE.md's own rule that mise.toml is the single source of truth for ruby/node/yarn. It is
  green today, which is exactly why it is easy to miss — a runner image bump could change the
  Node major under the build without any commit. Deliberately left alone during the Rails 8.1
  load_defaults work: the upgrade did not change the Node requirement, and the CI-sync workflow
  says not to touch a dimension the upgrade did not move. Add `jdx/mise-action` (already used by
  the `gitleaks` and `actions-lint` jobs) to the `test` job, or `actions/setup-node` with
  `node-version-file: .node-version`.

- **Sprockets-era `config.assets.*` keys survive under Propshaft.**
  The app moved to Propshaft (`Gemfile:9`, propshaft 1.3.2) but
  `config/environments/development.rb:65-69` still sets `config.assets.quiet`,
  `config.assets.debug`, `config.assets.compile` and `config.assets.digest`. Propshaft implements
  none of those — there is no compilation step, no debug mode and digests are unconditional — so
  they are dead config that reads as if it does something. (`config.assets.paths` and
  `config.assets.version` in `config/initializers/assets.rb` are real and Propshaft honours them;
  keep those.) Harmless because `config.assets` is an OrderedOptions that swallows unknown keys,
  which is also why nothing has flagged it. Delete the four dead lines.

- **CLAUDE.md's "Known pre-existing issues" section is stale.**
  It claims `bin/rails test` is "26 runs, 4 errors", `bin/rubocop` has "201 offences" and
  `herb analyze` fails on a stray comma in `_navbar.html.erb`. As of this pass all three are
  clean: 48 runs / 0 failures / 0 errors, 76 files / no offences, 43/43 files clean. Items 1, 2
  and 3 should be struck so the list stops describing regressions that no longer exist.

- **Rails' own `new_framework_defaults` templates ship two lines that are silent no-ops.**
  Found while working through the 8.0 and 8.1 defaults. Both
  `Rails.application.config.action_dispatch.strict_freshness = true` (8.0 template) and
  `Rails.configuration.active_support.escape_js_separators_in_json = false` (8.1 template) are
  copied out of `config.*` by railtie initializers — `action_dispatch.configure` at position 26
  and `active_support.set_configs` at position 20 — both of which run before
  `load_config_initializers` at position 113 loads `config/initializers/*`. Uncommenting either
  line in the generated file changes nothing; the consuming attribute keeps its old value. Anyone
  using these files to trial defaults one at a time needs to set those two in
  `config/application.rb` instead, and should read the value back from the consuming object
  (`ActionDispatch::Http::Cache::Request.strict_freshness`,
  `ActiveSupport.escape_js_separators_in_json`) rather than trusting the assignment. Worth an
  upstream Rails issue.
